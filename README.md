# FPS-Demo
This is my COMP SCI 559 Project. It uses ammojs for physics, and threejs for graphics. 
It is a first-person shooter where the goal is to clear the red balls out of the zone while they chase you around the map. Use WASD to move around, SPACEBAR to jump from the ground, mouse to look around, and left click to shoot.
My initial reference was SimonDev's FirstPersonCamera Demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqKzxPMLWxo&t=386s&ab_channel=SimonDev where I took off from and ended up changing entirely.
Skybox was generated using AI from http://www.humus.name
Shotgun sprites were taken directly from my own Doom.wad files.
